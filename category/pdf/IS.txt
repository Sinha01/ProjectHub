Q> what is computer auditing in information security?

	Computer auditing in information security is the process of systematically 
	reviewing and evaluating an organization's computer systems and networks 
	to assess their compliance with established security policies and identify potential 
	vulnerabilities or security breaches. The steps in a computer audit typically include:

	Planning: This step involves identifying the scope of the audit, determining the objectives, and developing a plan of action.

	Preparation: This step involves gathering information about the systems and networks to be audited, including 
	identifying hardware and software configurations, network topology, and security policies.

	Inspection: This step involves examining the systems and networks for compliance with security policies and for 
	any potential vulnerabilities. This can include reviewing log files, analyzing network traffic, and conducting vulnerability assessments.

	Testing: This step involves conducting tests to verify that the systems and networks are configured correctly and that
 	security controls are working as intended.

	Reporting: This step involves documenting the findings of the audit and providing recommendations for addressing any 
	issues or vulnerabilities identified.

	Follow-up: This step involves monitoring the systems and networks to ensure that any issues or vulnerabilities identified during the 
	audit are properly addressed and resolved.

	Reviewing: This step involves regularly reviewing the previous audit and testing the security against the latest threats and vulnerabilities.

	Overall, the goal of computer auditing is to help ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organization's information assets 
	by identifying and mitigating potential security risks.


Q.> system access control ?

	System access control refers to the mechanisms and processes 
	used to control access to computer systems and networks, 
	including who can log in, what actions they can perform, 
	and what data they can access. 

	This can include setting permissions and roles for users, implementing authentication 
	and authorization procedures, and using encryption to protect data. The goal of system 	
	access control is to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive systems and 
	data, while also preventing unauthorized access or breaches.

	- Examples of system access controls include:

	*Passwords and multi-factor authentication
	*Firewalls and intrusion detection systems
	*Role-based access controls
	*Encryption of data at rest and in transit
	*Logging and monitoring of system access activities
	*Regularly scheduled software updates and patches.


Q> Data access control in information security?

	Data access control in information securityrefers
	to the mechanisms and processes used to control 
	access to data,including who can view, modify, or
	delete data. This can include setting permissions
	and roles for users, implementing authentication
	and authorization procedures, and using encryption 
	to protect data. The goal of data access control is
	to ensure that only authorized users have access to
	sensitive data, while also preventing unauthorized access or breaches.

	- Examples of data access controls include:

	*Role-based access controls (RBAC)
	*Access control lists (ACLs)
	*Data encryption
	*Data masking
	*Data classification
	*Regularly scheduled software updates and patches.
	*It is an important aspect of overall information 
	    security strategy, and helps to protect against 
	   data breaches, unauthorized access, and other potential threats.

Q>  what is DAC ? explain Decretionary access control with example"?

	Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is a type of access control that allows the owner or administrator of 
	a resource to determine who is allowed access to that resource and what they are allowed to do with it. This 
	type of access control is based on the principle of discretionary access, which means that the owner or
	administrator has the discretion to decide who is granted access and what level of access they are granted.

	An example of discretionary access control would be a file system on a computer. 
	The owner of the file system, who is typically the person who created the files, can decide who has access to the 
	files and what they are allowed to do with them. For example, the owner might decide that certain files are only
	 accessible to certain individuals, such as members of a specific group or department, or that certain files can only be read and not modified.
	

Q> what is MAC ? explain Mandatory access control with example"	
	
	MAC stands for "Mandatory Access Control." It is a type of access control in which access to resources is strictly
	controlled based on predefined security rules and policies. 
	These rules and policies are enforced by the system and cannot be overridden by users or individual processes.

	One example of a system that uses MAC is the U.S. government's classification system for national security information. 
	under this system, information is classified into different levels (e.g. Confidential, Secret, Top Secret) based on its sensitivity.
	 Access to information at a particular level is only granted to individuals who have been cleared for that level and have a 
	"need to know" the information. This ensures that sensitive information is only seen by authorized individuals and is not accidentally
 	or maliciously disclosed to those who should not have access to it.






































































	1. Why is a methodology important in the implementation of information security ? How does a methodology improve the process ? Explain.

	Methodology ensures the strict/ perfectly defined process and it increases the likelihood of success.
	 It improves the process because it unifies the process of identifying specific threats and the creation of
 	specific controls to counter those threats into a coherent program.

	Methodology is a technique that has a sequence of all procedures to complete the task. It is important in information security
	because it ensures that the data is stored in orderly and secured manner. It has the process of identifying the threats and also the 
	procedures to remove the threats like hacker.
